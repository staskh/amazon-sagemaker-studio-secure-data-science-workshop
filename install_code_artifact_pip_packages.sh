# This script installs pip packages in shared data science code artifact repository and disassociates external
# connection to public PyPI repository.
#
# This script should be run after code artifact has been created in the target AWS account.
#
# The script requires CodeArtifact Admin permissions, add following Managed Policy to Role used to run the script:
# arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCodeArtifactAdminAccess
#
# This script assumes a Linux or MacOSX environment and relies on the following software packages being installed:
# . - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) v2 latest version that supports codeartifact commands
# . - Python 3 / pip3
#
# This script assumes you have configured pip to use AWS CodeArtifact, if not use the provided code_artifact_login.sh
# script to configure pip. Note that CodeArtifact token is by default valid for 12 hours, so you may have to run it again if
# token as expired.

# Modify the variables for your environment
# DOMAIN_OWNER is AWS Account Number

DS_SHARED_CODE_ARTIFACT_PUBLIC_UPSTREAM_REPO=ds-public-upstream-repo

# Set AWS_PROFILE variable in environment if needed

# Install pip packages, this will download and cache pip packages in CodeArtifact shared repo

# Disassociate external public PyPI connection to restrict package download from public PYPI repo.

# if an external connection exists.
# The connection can be associated again to install new packages in the shared repo by using:
# aws codeartifact associate-external-connection
